Subject: [Xml2ddl-general] Welcome to the mailing list
Message-ID: <b3dc5117041007141657b51c5b@mail.gmail.com>

The purpose of this mailing list is for users and developers to keep
up-to-date with what is going on with Xml2Ddl.
It's also a forum for offering suggestions, making announcements or
any other topic of interest.
Eventually, if this list starts to become too busy I'll split it into
other lists.

At the moment it has been pretty quiet, I only received one e-mail
(via another route).
So I'm anxious to hear what you think.

-Scott
